This course make me know that this term we mainly focused machine learning and hardware, and using them in an abstracted form, what’s more, practiced to data analysis and storytelling.
Concrete content :
1.This class professor show some pictures and videos for us . Those make us know clearly that what we will study in the next time.
2.In the class , two tutors teach us download some useful Software ( GitHub, Anaconda and Vscode) ,those software can make us better to study , finish the task and cross work.
3.Final ,the professor teach us how to show “hello world”by some Operation steps.sear( input #this is a command ,and then input print (“Hello world!”))
Of course, the professor show 3 step process:
1.Diagnose and dissect .
2.Search for solution to the problem .
3.Implement ,understand and tweak the found solution .
These can guide us to learn how to learn, so I thinking they are very important.
Through this lesson, I feel that it is a bit difficult to me. Because I don’t have basics about this before ,I spend a lot time at the beginning of class. Fortunately, I'm very interested in this course, so I will work hard on this course. I think my ability has improved to some degree in the next time.
