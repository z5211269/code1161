TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I finish these, but I know that do I do it right. Because I think that I really understand these question.
I have some question of these questions.
For example:1. I always don't know that what should be written in the first step
            2. I don't know that what actualNumber is mean.
