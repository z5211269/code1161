TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This class we study seven parts about pythonï¼ˆvalues, variable,expressions,function,collections,flow control and lteration). This seven parts shows that we can use differert way to expression some things. And these make us know some detail problem , when I am doing my exercise ,I know that how I should correct mistake. Now, I know what % means. And I also know that how I should use if, else and elif. There are different to different symbol. For example, (),[] and {} ,they have different roles in different situations.
To another lab , we also study seven parts about python (expressions, data types, variables, control flow, looping, collections and errors), there are some part with the same as lecture, only data types, looping and errors different. To looping and errors ,I am not very skilled, so I can't do some questions of exercise. But I can ask tutor and my classmates to solve these questions.
